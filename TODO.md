hmness TODO
===========

* Write a basic database structure, add a few examples via the admin interface
* Extend the django user profile (see this [article](http://gistflow.com/posts/725-how-to-extend-the-behaviour-of-the-user-class-in-django-1-5)); for the time being it is fine to write code specific to Django 1.4; the update should be easy later once 1.5 enters Debian/Ubuntu repositories
* Set up user login/logout interface
* Allow users to log in via Google, Facebook
* Add any new projects to south
* Theme bootstrap (see [Cerulean](http://bootswatch.com/cerulean/) and [Spruce](http://bootswatch.com/spruce/))
* Add [FontAwesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) integration in order to access a wider set of icons in various sizes

Deployment tasks
================

* Change SECRET_KEY in ```settings.py```
