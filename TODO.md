Issues
======

* Migrating users to south gave some errors; investigate this

Lower priority tasks
====================

* Login form(s) should not post unless text is present in both fields
* Should the navbar login form should use Django forms?

Longterm tasks
==============

* Allow users to log in with an email (this involves ensuring email uniqueness, and using a custon authentication backend)
* Theme bootstrap (see [Cerulean](http://bootswatch.com/cerulean/) and [Spruce](http://bootswatch.com/spruce/))
* Convert user profile to Django 1.5 once packages are released for Debian/Ububuntu
* Template ```{% url %}``` syntax changed from Django 1.4 to 1.5; we need to add quotations around view names when upgrading

Deployment tasks
================

* Change SECRET_KEY in ```settings.py```
