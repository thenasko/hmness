The Homeness Project

Introduction
------------

(TODO: Add a description of the goals and ideas behind this project.)

Technical setup
---------------

The current prerequisites of the project are
* git
* python-django

Use the following command to check out the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/thenasko/hmness.git hmness-project
```

To start the application change to `hmness-project/hmness` and run
```
python manage.py runserver
```
You can then direct your browser to `localhost:8000`. If you are using a remote machine, add `0.0.0.0:8000` at the end of the command above to allow external access.

(TODO: Write a brief note on setting up a testing/development environment.)

See (our TODO list)[TODO.md] for tasks we would like to accomplish.
